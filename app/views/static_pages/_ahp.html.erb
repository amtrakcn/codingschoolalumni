    The CSAA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not tolerate harassment of members, whether in-person or online, in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event, including talks. Members or participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and group at the discretion of the organizers.

    You are also responsible for making sure any guests you bring to events are aware of and abide by this policy as well.

  <p>
    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.
