Welcome, <%= @user.fname %>!


You're now signed up for the Coding School Alumni Association.


We'll be in touch shortly about our kickoff event.  


Otherwise, where we go from here is largely up to you.  Let us know what you want to do with your fellow alums!


We've got the power of a large group of amazing people behind us and can use it to pull together some pretty exciting stuff: speakers, networking, education, hackathons, kickball teams... you name it, you got it.  


Also, if you'd like to get involved and help organize or contribute in any way, please let me know at erik@theodinproject.com.


I can't wait to see you out at our next event!


Sincerely,

Erik Trautman
President, CSAA
