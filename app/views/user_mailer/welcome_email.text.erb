Welcome, <%= @user.fname %>!


You're now signed up for the Coding School Alumni Association.


Our kickoff event, titled "Turning a Non-Traditional Background into a Successful Engineering Career", will occur on November 20th in San Francisco.  


View the details and get your ticket at http://csaakickoff.eventbrite.com.


After that, where we go is largely up to you.  Let us know what you want to do with your fellow alums!


We've got the power of a large group of amazing people behind us and can use it to pull together some pretty exciting stuff: speakers, networking, education, hackathons, kickball teams... you name it, you got it.  And that includes more than just San Francisco stuff.


Also, if you'd like to get involved and help organize or contribute in any way, please let me know at erik@theodinproject.com.


I can't wait to see you out at our next event!


Sincerely,

Erik Trautman
President, CSAA
